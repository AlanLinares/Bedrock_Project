## Setting up the Backend (server side)

Ready to unleash the power of our backend? Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Install the necessary packages in the server directory by running this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Set up your environment variables by creating a .env file in the server directory and adding the following code:

    ```javascript
    MONGO_URI = <your mongoDB credentials string here>
    
    ```

    This will allow you to use environment variables in your project. I am using hardcoded Port 5000 in my code. 

3. Once your dependencies and environment variables are set up, it's time to run the server! In your terminal, navigate to the server directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```

    And voila! Your backend is ready to go!

## Setting up the Frontend (client side)


1. Install the necessary packages in the client directory by running this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. With the packages installed, you're good to go! Just make sure your server is running and open up another terminal window. Navigate to the client directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run client
    ```

    And that's all.
